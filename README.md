# HideItems
This is a GNOME extension from GNOME 45,46.

The idea is came from MacOS, [Hidden](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden) extension.
This extension provide help for a clean interface on the top bar.

## Update:
Now you can select different icons of the top panel!
This is ‚ö†Ô∏èEXPERIMENTAL‚ö†Ô∏è, there is could be some bugs ü™≤!

There could be bugs with other extensions, with multiple icons.

I found out like: ([ Tray icon reloaded ](https://github.com/MartinPL/Tray-Icons-Reloaded))

New settings is the indicator could have default visibility if save state if off!

Now you can set default what icons shown, and delete unnecessarily data from local json file!

I tested on GNOME 45,46
Probably it will work on every icon on the _rightBox item. I still not figure out what happens if some icon is appear on the right side of my extensions icon, but im working on it üôÇ.

Dont use with top panel organiser extension, it can brake it.
